# WIP of DP and SMPC including logistic regression
Usage right now:
the folder data must include:
    config.yaml
    test_set.csv
    trainig_set.csv
Then
    1. featurecloud controller start must be called while within the fc-private-logistic-regression folder
    2. configuration of tests can be done in config.yaml
    3. bash app_build_start.sh must be called to run a test
    4. results are currently prited so they can be found in data/logs and the most current log with a weird autogenerated name
